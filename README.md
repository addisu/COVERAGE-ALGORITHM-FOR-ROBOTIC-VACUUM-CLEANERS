COVERAGE ALGORITHM FOR ROBOTIC VACUUM CLEANERS
The essence of autonomous mobile robots lies in their ability to navigate through cluttered environments, exhibiting seamless and efficient motion control. In the realm of robotic vacuum cleaners, this aspect is of paramount importance, influencing their performance and usability. This thesis, titled "Coverage Algorithms for Robotic Vacuum Cleaners," actions to shed light on the critical focus required in navigating these automated cleaning devices. Our objective is to thoroughly explore and analyze Coverage Algorithms that empower robotic vacuum cleaners to efficiently maneuver within indoor spaces, taking into account various environmental constraints.


This study focuses on leveraging advanced Coverage Algorithms, including A* with heuristic, backtracking, and Boustrophedon motions, to optimize the navigation of robotic vacuum cleaners. In recent years, robotic vacuum cleaners have gained immense popularity due to their ability to autonomously clean indoor spaces. Efficient navigation is crucial to ensure thorough and effective cleaning. The A* algorithm, known for its prowess in identifying the shortest path between points, is specifically tailored to devise optimal cleaning routes. This algorithm considers the environment's layout, furniture placement, and potential obstacles to chart the most efficient cleaning path. By implementing A* and integrating heuristic, backtracking, and Boustrophedon motions into robotic path planning, we significantly enhance the robot's safety and effectiveness in navigating its environment, thus broadening the spectrum of practical applications.
